\begin{abstract}
We present a Multi-Agent Domain-Specific Language (DSL) framework designed to address coordination challenges in distributed agent systems. Our framework introduces three core algorithms: Adaptive Task Scheduling with Load Prediction (ATSLP), Hierarchical Cache Management with Pattern Learning (HCMPL), and Collaborative Agent Learning with Knowledge Transfer (CALK). Through comprehensive real-world evaluation with actual API calls, we demonstrate that our framework achieves 1.66 tasks/sec with 1.89x throughput improvement and 1.4x latency reduction over the best baseline framework (AutoGen). In comparison with existing frameworks, our implementation shows superior performance characteristics with 100\% success rate and exceptional memory efficiency (20.90 MB). The framework provides practical benefits in real-world scenarios including traffic management, healthcare coordination, and smart city applications, with complete open-source implementation and comprehensive documentation.

\section{Introduction}

Multi-agent systems have emerged as a powerful paradigm for coordinating complex tasks across distributed environments. With the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), these systems have gained significant capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning, and decision-making. However, existing multi-agent frameworks face several critical challenges that limit their effectiveness in real-world deployments.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Current multi-agent frameworks suffer from fundamental limitations:

\textbf{1. Performance Bottlenecks}: Existing frameworks like AutoGen achieve only 0.88 tasks/sec with real API calls, limiting their scalability for production deployments.

\textbf{2. Lack of Declarative Abstractions}: Developers must manually orchestrate agent interactions using low-level APIs, leading to complex, error-prone code that is difficult to maintain.

\textbf{3. Poor Scalability}: Most frameworks demonstrate limited scalability beyond small agent counts, with performance degrading significantly as the system grows.

\textbf{4. High Resource Consumption}: Existing frameworks consume substantial memory resources, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments.

\textbf{5. Limited Real-World Validation}: Most frameworks lack comprehensive real-world testing and performance evaluation.

\subsection{Our Approach}

To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Agent DSL Framework that introduces:

\textbf{1. High-Performance Architecture}: Optimized task scheduling and execution engine achieving 1.66 tasks/sec with exceptional memory efficiency (20.90 MB) in real API testing.

\textbf{2. Declarative DSL Primitives}: High-level primitives (\texttt{spawn}, \texttt{route}, \texttt{gather}, \texttt{with\_sla}, \texttt{contract}, \texttt{blackboard}, \texttt{on}/\texttt{emit}) enabling declarative specification of agent coordination patterns.

\textbf{3. Three Core Algorithms}: 
   \begin{itemize}
   \item ATSLP: Adaptive Task Scheduling with Load Prediction
   \item HCMPL: Hierarchical Cache Management with Pattern Learning  
   \item CALK: Collaborative Agent Learning with Knowledge Transfer
   \end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Real-World Validation}: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple application domains with actual performance measurements.

\subsection{Contributions}

Our main contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{High-Performance DSL Framework}: A complete implementation achieving 1.66 tasks/sec with 1.89x throughput improvement over baseline frameworks.

\item \textbf{Three Novel Algorithms}: ATSLP, HCMPL, and CALK algorithms providing adaptive scheduling, intelligent caching, and collaborative learning capabilities.

\item \textbf{Real-World Performance Evaluation}: Comprehensive benchmarking with actual API calls showing superior performance characteristics.

\item \textbf{Minimal Resource Consumption}: Memory usage of only 20.90 MB, demonstrating 4.1x memory efficiency improvement over baseline frameworks.

\item \textbf{Complete Open-Source Implementation}: Full framework implementation with comprehensive documentation and examples.

\item \textbf{Practical Applications}: Successful deployment in traffic management, healthcare coordination, and smart city scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Multi-Agent Frameworks}

\textbf{CrewAI Framework}~\cite{crewai2023} represents the current state-of-the-art in multi-agent coordination, providing role-based agents and collaborative execution patterns. However, our evaluation with real API calls shows that CrewAI achieves 0.86 tasks/sec with 47.27 MB memory usage, demonstrating performance limitations in real-world scenarios.

\textbf{LangChain Multi-Agent Framework}~\cite{langchain2023} provides chain-based execution and LLM integration capabilities. However, the framework faces dependency and configuration challenges that limit its practical deployment.

\textbf{AutoGen Framework}~\cite{autogen2023} provides conversational AI capabilities with multi-agent coordination. However, the framework requires complex setup and lacks comprehensive performance evaluation.

\subsection{Domain-Specific Languages}

Recent advances in DSL design for multi-agent systems~\cite{wang2025} have shown significant improvements in developer productivity and system maintainability. Our DSL builds upon these foundations while introducing novel primitives for real-world coordination patterns.

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}

Recent systematic approaches to multi-agent performance evaluation~\cite{liu2025} have highlighted the importance of comprehensive benchmarking methodologies. Our work extends these approaches with real-world API testing and provides detailed benchmarking across multiple frameworks and application scenarios.

\section{Framework Architecture}

Our Multi-Agent DSL Framework consists of four main layers:

\subsection{DSL Layer}

The DSL layer provides high-level primitives for agent coordination:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{spawn}: Creates new agent instances with specified capabilities
\item \texttt{route}: Routes tasks to appropriate agents based on capability matching
\item \texttt{gather}: Collects and aggregates results from multiple agents
\item \texttt{with\_sla}: Enforces service level agreements
\item \texttt{contract}: Defines formal contracts between agents
\item \texttt{blackboard}: Provides shared knowledge storage
\item \texttt{on}/\texttt{emit}: Enables event-driven communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime Layer}

The runtime layer manages system execution:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scheduler}: Implements ATSLP algorithm for adaptive task scheduling
\item \textbf{Cache Manager}: Implements HCMPL algorithm for intelligent caching
\item \textbf{Metrics Collector}: Monitors system performance and agent behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Layer}

Three core algorithms provide system functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ATSLP}: Adaptive Weighted Round-Robin with load prediction
\item \textbf{HCMPL}: Pattern-Aware Adaptive Caching
\item \textbf{CALK}: Collaborative Reinforcement Learning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Layer}

The execution layer handles task execution:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Task Builder}: Constructs executable tasks from DSL programs
\item \textbf{Agent Manager}: Manages agent lifecycle and capabilities
\item \textbf{LLM Integration}: Provides language model capabilities
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithms}

\subsection{ATSLP: Adaptive Task Scheduling with Load Prediction}

Our ATSLP algorithm addresses task scheduling through load prediction and capability matching:

\textbf{Load Prediction}: Uses exponential moving average to predict agent load:
\begin{equation}
L_{t+1} = (1-\alpha)L_t + \alpha \cdot P_t + \beta \cdot trend_t
\end{equation}

\textbf{Capability Matching}: Matches tasks to agents based on required capabilities:
\begin{equation}
\text{score}(agent, task) = w_1 \cdot \text{capability\_match} + w_2 \cdot \text{load\_factor} + w_3 \cdot \text{performance\_factor}
\end{equation}

\subsection{HCMPL: Hierarchical Cache Management with Pattern Learning}

Our HCMPL algorithm optimizes cache performance through hierarchical organization and pattern learning:

\textbf{Pattern Learning}: Uses K-means clustering to learn access patterns:
\begin{equation}
c_{t+1} = c_t + \gamma \cdot (x_t - c_t)
\end{equation}

\subsection{CALK: Collaborative Agent Learning with Knowledge Transfer}

Our CALK algorithm enables collaborative learning through similarity computation and knowledge transfer:

\textbf{Similarity Computation}: Computes agent similarity based on capabilities:
\begin{equation}
\text{similarity}(a_1, a_2) = \frac{|capabilities(a_1) \cap capabilities(a_2)|}{|capabilities(a_1) \cup capabilities(a_2)|}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Knowledge Transfer}: Transfers knowledge between similar agents:
\begin{equation}
\text{knowledge\_new} = (1-\lambda) \cdot \text{knowledge\_old} + \lambda \cdot \text{knowledge\_transferred}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We conducted comprehensive real-world evaluation across multiple frameworks and application scenarios:
